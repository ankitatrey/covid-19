<h1 align="center">Self awareness of people in society</h1>

<h3>
The following things, when done by people in a society reflects the self awareness of people in society.
</h3>
<br>
<br>
<ol>
<li> COVID-19 has and is likely to affect people from many countries, in many geographical locations.
When referring to people with COVID-19, do not attach the disease to any particular ethnicity or
nationality. Be empathetic to all those who are affected, in and from any country. People who are
affected by COVID-19 have not done anything wrong, and they deserve our support, compassion
and kindness.
</li><br><li> Do not refer to people with the disease as “COVID-19 cases”, “victims” “COVID-19 families” or
“the diseased”. They are “people who have COVID-19”, “people who are being treated for
COVID-19”, or “people who are recovering from COVID-19”, and after recovering from COVID-19
their life will go on with their jobs, families and loved ones. It is important to separate a person
from having an identity defined by COVID-19, in order to reduce stigma.

<br>
<li> Minimize watching, reading or listening to news about COVID-19 that causes you to feel anxious
  or distressed; seek information only from trusted sources and mainly so that you can take practical
  steps to prepare your plans and protect yourself and loved ones. Seek information updates at
  specific times during the day, once or twice. The sudden and near-constant stream of news reports
  about an outbreak can cause anyone to feel worried. Get the facts; not rumours and
  misinformation. Gather information at regular intervals from the WHO website and local health
  authority platforms in order to help you distinguish facts from rumours. Facts can help to minimize
  fears. 
</li><br><li> Protect yourself and be supportive to others. Assisting others in their time of need can benefit
both the person receiving support and the helper. For example, check by telephone on neighbours
or people in your community who may need some extra assistance. Working together as one
community can help to create solidarity in addressing COVID-19 together.
</li><br><li> Find opportunities to amplify positive and hopeful stories and positive images of local people who
have experienced COVID-19. For example, stories of people who have recovered or who have supported
a loved one and are willing to share their experience.
</li><br><li> Honour carers and healthcare workers supporting people affected with COVID-19 in your
community. Acknowledge the role they play in saving lives and keeping your loved ones safe.
