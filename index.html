       	   	  <p>Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).[8] The disease was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, the capital of China's Hubei province, and has since spread globally, resulting in the ongoing 2019â€“20 coronavirus pandemic.[9][10] As of 3 May 2020, more than 3.44 million cases have been reported across 187 countries and territories, resulting in more than 244,000 deaths. More than 1.1 million people have recovered.[7]

Common symptoms include fever, cough, fatigue, shortness of breath, and loss of smell and taste.[5][11][12] While the majority of cases result in mild symptoms, some progress to viral pneumonia, multi-organ failure, or cytokine storm.[9][13][14] The time from exposure to onset of symptoms is typically around five days but may range from two to fourteen days.[5][15]</p>
